Description: Development files for the zxcvbn password strength estimation library
 zxcvbn is a password strength estimator inspired by password crackers. Through 
 pattern matching and conservative estimation, it recognizes and weighs 30k 
 common passwords, common names and surnames according to US census data, 
 popular English words from Wikipedia and US television and movies, and other 
 common patterns like dates, repeats (aaa), sequences (abcd), keyboard patterns 
 (qwertyuiop), and l33t speak.

 Consider using zxcvbn as an algorithmic alternative to password composition
 policy â€” it is more secure, flexible, and usable when sites require a minimal
 complexity score in place of annoying rules like "passwords must contain three
 of {lower, upper, numbers, symbols}".
